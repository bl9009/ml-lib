# Python Machine Learning Library
by Benjamin Labas

Implementations of machine learning models and algorithms to help me getting a better understanding of how these algorithms work and improving intuition of how to use them.

Implemented in Python 3.6 and NumPy 1.13.

## Models
Following machine learning models are available so far:

#### Regressors
- Linear regression (Stochastic Gradient Descent, Normal Equation)
- Logistic regression
- Polynomial regression

#### Classifiers
- Logistic classification
- Decision Tree classification
- Support Vector Machines (under construction)
- Artificial Neural Networks
  - Multi-layer Perceptron (under construction)


## Others
Following algorithms/utilities are included:
- Cross-validation
- Multiclass classification (OneVsAll)
- Feature scaler (Min-max scaler, Standardizer)
- Metrics (RSS, MSE, LogLoss, Gini impurity etc.)

## Planned
Following features are planned:
- k-Nearest Neighbors classification
- NaiveBayes classification
- Ensemble learning methods (bagging, stacking)
- Boosting (AdaBoost)
- More Artificial Neural Networks:
  - Recurrent Neural Network
  - Convolutional Neural Network
